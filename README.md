## About me
####  Through my studies and experience, I’ve learned that making strategic decisions is challenging for businesses of all sizes. I’ve developed a strong foundation in retail, distribution, customer analysis, and data analysis, along with skills in Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Machine Learning. My goal is to become a Data Analyst within three years and eventually grow into a Business Intelligence expert, using data to help businesses make informed decisions and drive sustainable growth.
